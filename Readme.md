# üåü Building My Portfolio with MkDocs

In this guide, we will use **MkDocs** to build a professional portfolio. MkDocs is a static site generator specifically designed for project documentation. It is written in Python and uses the Jinja2 templating engine to generate HTML pages from Markdown files. MkDocs is simple, efficient, and perfect for creating and maintaining documentation for your projects.
